        <p id="mahasthangarh">Bogra a northern district in the Rajshahi Division, is called the gateway to the north Bengal. It has an important place in the legendary earlier historical annals of Bengal as it was the capital of Ancient Kingdom Pundravardhana (the kingdom of the Pundras). Pundravardhana's history dates back as far as 1280BC. Remains from this ancient kingdom capital still lies in Bogra, now known as Mahasthangarh.<br>

Pundravardhana was one of the kingdoms of Eastern India and was separated by the stream of Karatoya from the more easternly kingdom of Prag-Jyotisha or Kamrupa. The name, Pundravardhana, occurs frequently in the Mahabharata, Ramayana and the various Puranas. According to the Mahabharata and the Puranas, Vasudeva, a powerful prince of the Pundra family, is said to have ruled over Pundravardhana as far back as 1280 B.C. At present Bogra is an industrial city with many small and mid sized industries.<br>

A limestone slab bearing six lines in Prakrit in Brahmi script, discovered in 1931, dates Mahasthangarh to at least 300BC and indicates it was part of the Mauryan empire during 300B.C – 200B.C. Northern Black Polished Ware potteries, Terracotta Figurines and punch-marked coins attests close relations with the Ganges Valley.

Large houses with tile-roofing were uncovered in the Eastern area, together with a large number of finely decorated terracotta figurines.
